Lab 1 - Set Cover

- Given a family of sets, find the subfamily of minimum cost that covers all elements in the universe
- Several possible greedy algorithms
- Classical testbench in combinatorics, computer science, operations research, and complexity theory
- One of Karp's 21 problems shown to be NP-complete in 1972
